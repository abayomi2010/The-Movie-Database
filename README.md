# The-Movie-Database
A group built project in which users search for movies info which are then retrieved from the OMDb API and rendered to the page, featuring searched movie info, notifications and api driven links to places to stream. Users can create a persistent favourite movie list which is saved to local storage which offers suggestions for similar movies.
